## 🧰 AI Agent SDK for GitHub Actions

The **AI Agent SDK** is a developer-friendly toolkit to run AI-powered agents directly within GitHub Actions.

### 🔑 Key Features

* ✅ **AI-Driven Automation**: Offload tasks to LLMs like GPT-4, such as writing code, summarizing issues, or generating documentation.
* 🔐 **Secure Key Handling**: Supports `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and other secrets via GitHub’s encrypted secrets.
* 📦 **Minimal Setup**: Works out of the box with a lightweight Python SDK and simple YAML configuration.
* 🔁 **Custom Agents**: Build reusable and composable agents for testing, deployment, labeling, or issue triage.
* 💡 **Multi-model Support**: Compatible with OpenAI, Anthropic, and local LLMs.
